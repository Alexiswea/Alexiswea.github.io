            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>The project was abotu creating a graphical scene using Python's Turtle graphics module. I used the building block functions like draw_rectange, draw_circle, draw_triangle, etc to create functions that made shapes to where I could create images like a tree and clouds. Then I refactored the code by creating a code like draw_house and implementing the other functions eariler to create an image of a house so I would not have to retype the functions of draw_rectange,etc instead this helps me create a thousand houses if I so please.</p>

            <h2>Sample code</h2>
            <p>The picture below describes what I mentioned eariler about creating a function with other building block functions to make the process easier and faster. The one at the top is a draw_cloud function where I placed a bunch of draw_circle functions closely together but far away enough to create the chape of a cloud in the final scene.</p>

            <h2>Final Scene</h2>
            <P>The final scene is a house with clouds and the sun. The house uses rectangles and triangles, while the clouds are just overlapping circles.</P>
